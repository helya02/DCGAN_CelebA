# DCGAN_CelebA
The key idea behind DCGAN is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as both the generator and discriminator models in a GAN framework. The generator network takes random noise as input and gradually upsamples it to generate synthetic images. The discriminator network, on the other hand, learns to distinguish between real and generated images.
